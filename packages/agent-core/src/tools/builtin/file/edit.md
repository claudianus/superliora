Perform exact replacements in existing files.

- Edit is mandatory for every incremental change, especially small edits. DO NOT use Write or Bash `sed`.
- Read the target file before every Edit. DO NOT call Edit from memory, stale context, or a guessed `old_string`.
- Take `old_string`/`new_string` from the Read output view. Drop the line-number prefix and tab; match only file content.
